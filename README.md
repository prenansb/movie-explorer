- Fetches additional movie details on demand
- Responsive design with backdrop image
- Accessible with keyboard navigation and focus management

### Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Individual movie pages are statically generated
- Improved SEO and performance
- Dynamic metadata generation for each movie

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for:

- Component rendering and interactions
- Custom hooks functionality
- API integration (mocked)
- User interactions and edge cases

Run tests with:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Storybook
